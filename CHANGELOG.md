# CHANGELOG

## Upcoming Changes

These changes are likely already pushed to the Github repo and will be included in the next StygianCore repack release.

#### _Module_

- Codebox NPC
  - GM can now create/read/update/delete codes in-game
  - GM can view a list of codes in the database
  - Player can now initiate race, name, and faction change with codes

## 2019.03.10 (Repack)

The StygianCore repack has been completely upgraded to the latest revision of AzerothCore. I did not want to delay the initial v2019.03.01 release of StygianCore, so it did not include the recently revised database structures or important commits from the AzerothCore repo that greatly improve the core.

**This update is not backward-compatible with the v2019.03.01 release. If you are using an earlier release, it is _highly suggested_ that you download and use this one to ensure compatibility with future releases and patches.**
